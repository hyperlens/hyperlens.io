Hyperlens — decentralized metaverse network combines Web3 and the physical world into a single, seamless experience. It enables businesses to create and users to enjoy a rich and comprehensive augmented reality (AR) world that seamlessly integrates digital and physical realities, accessed via everyday camera-enabled mobile devices. 

Hyperlens is built around the idea of <b>Lenses</b>: invisible, programmable layers of data that are detected by the camera and displayed interactively in a seamless AR experience. Superimposed upon reality, Lenses allow users to interact with a digital/physical hybrid world. Digital objects can be Lens-specific or accessible across all layers, and conforming to or independent of the laws of physics. They can be either simple interactable digital entities or tokenised blockchain-hosted items.

We are on a mission to fundamentally change how you work, play, and interact with other people and the world around you. We are changing your perception of the world and what you previously thought was possible to achieve this. We’re using everyday cameras in smartphones and creating lenses that alter how your camera views the world in front of you. It makes such a vast scope for creativity, education, and marketing we wanted to create a way for users to add and extract value from this new perception, so we made Hyperlens.

Hyperlens is built on two main technologies. The first is <b>spatial computing</b>, an emerging technology which uses a network of cameras to parse and interpret the physical world, enabling its use as the medium of interaction for applications as well as their source of data. The Hyperlens platform combines the concepts of AR, VR, mixed reality and extended reality, creating a digital-twin of the real world, which is then populated with different effects and objects – all of which can be viewed on camera-enabled devices from mobile phones to smart glasses.

Meanwhile, <b>blockchain</b> enables consumers and businesses populate this enhanced world with digital objects of value that can be programmed with their own economic conditions – thereby implementing powerful new business models. User interactions can similarly be programmed with conditions, and with a value attached. Blockchain integration also enables <b>ARDrop</b> functionality: the ability to distribute digital objects in significant locations and among key demographics to be collected and interacted with, for example as rewards or as part of a marketing campaign.

We started to create the concept of Hyperlens back in 2019. Since then, it continues to evolve as technology advances. From the middle of last year, we have been working on creating an MVP, which we will be ready to present to the general public in the second and third quarters of 2022.

Initially, our platform will work on smartphones (iOS and Android), but in the near future, when tech giants release smart glasses (as Apple, Facebook are already engaged in similar developments), we will adapt it to the wearables.

Hyperlens’s approach allows developers and businesses to make our physical environment not only a source of content for apps, but also their interface and distribution channel:
<ul>
<li>Wiki Lenses that display information about objects in the user’s camera view.</li>
<li>Nav Lenses that provide directions and transport information in real-time.</li>
<li>Fitness Lenses that show race position, goals and milestones;</li>
<li>Retail Lenses that offer digital reward points, special offers and promotions;</li>
<li>MMO Gaming Lenses, and many others.</li>

We will have GEM utility token as the native currency. Multiple revenue streams will drive value within a diverse economy of clients, end users and services. All transactions and services on the platform will be paid for using GEMs, including placing any digital object in the AR space. The market for custom Lenses, scan-to-unlock codes and Sponsored Lenses will provide further revenues.
